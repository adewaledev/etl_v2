# Dockerized Python ETL Pipeline

This repository contains a complete, automated, and Dockerized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. The pipeline reads data from a CSV file, transforms it, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database running in a separate Docker container.

The project demonstrates key concepts of Docker, including containerization, networking, and orchestration, all managed by a single bash script.
